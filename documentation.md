- Okay I got the code cloned to my device open installed the dependencies and got both the frontend and backend up and running. 

- I am a taken a little off guard now becasue I ran the get request for organizations which I assumed would have been prefilled for me in this challenge since my assumption was that I wouldn't have to worry about loading the data in, just about querying it and loading it out in the ui... I looked at the database files and it appears as though there was only sql written to define an organization and nothing else so from what I can tell I am going to have to load some of my own data in so that I can query it and display it to the ui so I think I will start with that. 

- I don't want to take tons of time so once I create the schemas for the accounts and deals I am going to use LLM to create some sql to create some data to load into the database... 

- I use lucid spark for notes and organizing my thoughts a lot so I am going to switch over to there and I can send that over if you would like after I turn this in... As of right now I am writing the instruction in my own words to make sure I clearly get what I am doing.
