- Okay I got the code cloned to my device open installed the dependencies and got both the frontend and backend up and running. 

- I am a taken a little off guard now becasue I ran the get request for organizations which I assumed would have been prefilled for me in this challenge since my assumption was that I wouldn't have to worry about loading the data in, just about querying it and loading it out in the ui... I looked at the database files and it appears as though there was only sql written to define an organization and nothing else so from what I can tell I am going to have to load some of my own data in so that I can query it and display it to the ui so I think I will start with that. 

- I don't want to take tons of time so once I create the schemas for the accounts and deals I am going to use LLM to create some sql to create some data to load into the database... 

- I use lucid spark for notes and organizing my thoughts a lot so I am going to switch over to there and I can send that over if you would like after I turn this in... As of right now I am writing the instruction in my own words to make sure I clearly get what I am doing. 

- still taking some notes in lucid spark but not too many now... I have spent 1.5 hours on this so far but I need to step away for a few hours. I plan on finishing it up later tonight within the 4 hour mark... I should be able to do the rest late tonight, but if not due to my schedule right now otherwise I won't get around to finishing it till this saturday. But I will keep track of how much time it takes me and report back honestly when I submit it.
